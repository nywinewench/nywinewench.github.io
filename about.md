title: About Julia Burke

I am either a wine lover who writes a lot or a writer who accidentally fell in love with wine, depending on where I start the story.

In 2008 I wandered into a [Western New York winery](http://www.freedomrunwinery.com/)
for a tasting and left with a job. In the small wine community of Niagara
County, then in its infancy, I discovered a passion for wine, and as I helped
clean tanks, pour for customers, and harvest grapes, I began to dream about
making my own.

In 2010, eager to continue my wine education, I traveled to Stellenbosch,
South Africa, for a harvest internship at [Blaauwklippen Vineyards](http://www.blaauwklippen.com/),
and this blog was born. I chronicled my wine adventures as well as observations about
South Africa’s extraordinarily rich culture; once again, I found myself
deeply in love.

Here in the US, I am constantly seeking great South African wine, and I keep an eye on the South African wine industry; you’ll find [ample discussion of both](/blog) in my blog archive. These days I am a wine educator currently based in Oregon, where I'm lucky enough to work in the Willamette Valley wine industry. In 2020 I [embarked on the Master of Wine study program](http://stellenbauchery.com/blog/10-01-2020/you-are-an-mw-student.html).

Examples of my work, recent appearances, observations from life as a wine professional and educator, and a bit more of my history can all be found here.

# Cheers!
