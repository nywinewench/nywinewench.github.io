title: About Julia Burke

I am either a wine lover who writes a lot or a writer who accidentally fell in love with wine, depending on where I start the story.

In 2008 I wandered into a [Western New York winery](http://www.freedomrunwinery.com/)
for a tasting and left with a job. In the small wine community of Niagara
County, then in its infancy, I discovered a passion for wine, and as I helped
clean tanks, pour for customers, and harvest grapes, I began to dream about
making my own.

In 2010, eager to continue my wine education, I traveled to Stellenbosch,
South Africa, for a harvest internship at [Blaauwklippen Vineyards](http://www.blaauwklippen.com/),
and this blog was born. I chronicled my wine adventures as well as observations about
South Africa’s extraordinarily rich culture; once again, I found myself
deeply in love.

Here in the US, I am constantly seeking great South African wine, and I keep an eye on the South African wine industry; you’ll find [ample discussion of both](/blog) in my blog archive. These days I am a wine educator pursuing my WSET Diploma and currently based in Oregon, where I'm lucky enough to work in the Willamette Valley wine industry. 

Examples of my work, podcast and media appearances, observations from life as a wine professional and educator, and a bit more of my history can all be found here.

# Cheers!
