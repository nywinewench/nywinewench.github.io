Listen to enough interviews with wine professionals and you’ll hear a familiar refrain as they tell their origin stories:

_“Well, someone took a chance on me…”_

_“I was in the right place at the right time…”_

_“I was grossly underqualified, but for some reason…”_

If we’re hearing these stories it’s because the people in question succeeded eventually and chose to make wine their life’s work—if things hadn’t worked out, they wouldn’t be interview subjects—but it can often seem like the wine industry is just full of lucky people. And that’s partly true: wine is a luxury industry, after all, and many wine professionals come from backgrounds where it was relatively easy to seize networking opportunities or take a low-paying job for the sake of experience. But if you’re in the early stages of considering a wine career, such anecdotes can be a little discouraging: What if you don’t have a trust fund to keep you afloat while you work for free, or parents with a restaurant business that allows you to network on the job?
