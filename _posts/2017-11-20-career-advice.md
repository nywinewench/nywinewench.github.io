After a bit of a hiatus from writing, you can now find posts in which I dispense my very best and most serious wine career advice on the website of my WSET Level 3 alma mater, the wonderful	 [Napa Valley Wine Academy](https://napavalleywineacademy.com/).

Their blog, [Pouring Points](https://napavalleywineacademy.com/blog/), is a great resource for current and prospective WSET students and alums. I'm going to be sharing some of what I've learned in my journey from part-time wine obsessive to full-timer and Diploma student, as well as interviewing folks much smarter and more impressive than I. 

Most recently, I wrote about [what I've learned about Oregon pinot](https://napavalleywineacademy.com/four-things-i-learned-about-pinot-noir/) since moving to the Willamette Valley, and shared a few other [things you can learn from working a harvest](https://napavalleywineacademy.com/lessons-learned-from-working-a-harvest/). Check it out!
