I recently got to join the fun folks at Mad Art Cast, the podcast of Mad Art Lab on the Skepchick Network, to discuss the science (and lack thereof) behind biodynamic wine. We got into a great discussion about wine romanticism, mysticism, and spirituality, and the relationship between wine and artists. [Have a listen here!](http://madartlab.com/the-literal-magic-of-biodynamic-wine-mad-art-cast/)

And the fabulous Jennifer Ouellette interviewed me for a very serious and important [Gizmodo piece](http://gizmodo.com/the-best-girl-scout-cookie-wine-pairings-tested-1756719276) in which wine and Girl Scout cookie pairings were tested. As a former Girl Scout and avid consumer of wine and cookies, I had a great time with this one.
