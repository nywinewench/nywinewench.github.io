#### Drink This
I've been drinking a lot of beer lately, and I have to say it's been really nice to reconnect with it. Before seeing _Get Out_ (more on that in a minute) I had a solid day-drinking session with a couple flights at my local-est brewery, [Begyle](http://begylebrewing.com/Begyle/21.html). It was a good chance to refresh myself on their lineup after almost a year in my leftover wine bubble. My favorites were Farmer's Tan, a really beautifully balanced saison that I could drink every day, and Pinball Wizard, a milk stout that has a slightly sweet note on the finish but a good roast to even it out. Since the brewery is open Mondays and has a simple, well lit, comfortable taproom that's kind of how I imagine my home office would be if I had one, it's a good place to do some political reading.

Missouri's drastically underfunded public defender's office (ranked 49 out of 50 states for public funding) has resulted in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU. Prolonged jail time for defendants while waiting for lawyers and insufficient time spent on cases are the standard; most alarmingly, the average time spent on cases involving juveniles is a mere 4.6 hours.

[__From Essence: Black People Need Sanctuary Cities, Too__](http://www.essence.com/news/politics/sanctuary-cities-black-families-immigrants)
With several mayors grandstanding to defy Trump's refugee/Muslim ban and anti-immigrant rhetoric by declaring their cities to be sanctuaries, Janaé Bonsu notes that no city can be considered a sanctuary unless its Black residents are safe from state violence. "Whether it’s stop-and-frisk or no-knock raids, both undocumented immigrants and U.S.-born Black folks have a vested stake in redefining what sanctuary really means, and in resisting Trump’s 'law-and-order' agenda," [Bonsu writes.](http://www.essence.com/news/politics/sanctuary-cities-black-families-immigrants)

I hit a major milestone last week: I saw my first horror movie in a theater ever. (My aversion to scary anything has been [well documented](http://skepchick.org/2016/08/stranger-things-for-wimps/).) After listening to [a great interview with Jordan Peele on the Combat Jack show](https://soundcloud.com/thecombatjackshow/the-jordan-peele-episode), which you should also listen to (minimal spoilers), I simply had to see _Get Out_, and it was absolutely incredible. If you haven't seen it yet, you must. Son of Baldwin has [one of the best discussions of the film I've read](https://medium.com/@SonofBaldwin/get-the-fuck-outta-here-a-dialogue-on-jordan-peeles-get-out-831fef18b2b3#.5uerga7yb) (spoilers).
